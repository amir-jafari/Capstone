Dear Alan:
I am extremely pleased that you will be able to lend us the bene-
fit of your considerable experience and expertise in ethnomusicology in
the production of the Voyager record.
Voyager I and Voyager II are unmanned deep space probes which will
be launched from Cape Canaveral in August and September, 1977. Their
mission is to examine close-up the major planets, Jupiter, Saturn, and
Uranus, their 20 some odd moons, and the rings of Saturn and Uranus.
After these fly-by observations are performed, the two spacecraft will
be ejected from the solar system, becoming mankind's third and fourth
interstellar space vehicles. The first two such vehicles, Pioneers 10
and 11, were launched some six years ago and contain a 6 x 9 inch gold
anodized aluminium plaque on which is etched some simple scientific in-
formation about the location of the Earth and the solar system in the
Milky Way Galaxy, and the moment in the ten billion year history of our
Galaxy when the spacecraft was launched. There are also drawings of a
man and woman.  The plaques were a sort of message in a bottle, cast
into the cosmic ocean, in case at some remote epoch in the future an
extraterrestrial civilization were to come upon Pioneer 10 or 11 and
wonder something about its origin.
Voyager permits us to continue on the Pioneer 10 and 11 experience,
but in a much richer way. When NASA asked me to chair a committee to
decide what should be the nature of the Voyager cosmic greeting card,
it soon became clear that much more information could be conveyed in the
same space on a metal mother of a phonograph record than on a plaque of
the same size. Since this is the 100th anniversary of Edison's invention
of the phonograph, a record seems particularly apt. NASA will be launching
on each Voyager a bonded pair of copper mothers containing the equivalent
of four sides of a 12-inch 33-1/3 rpm long playing record. One of these
sides will contain digital scientific information  largely diagrams
and pictures; a range of human voices, including some especially prepared
at the United Nations and one special greeting by Kurt Waldheim, the U.N.

music representative of all of humanity and music which represents
the best of humanity. We believe that public availability of a two-
record album identical in content with the flight record will stimulate
listeners to examine our civilization and culture and consider how we
wish to be represented to the Cosmos. In addition, it may be for many
people a first exposure to some of the diversity and quality of human
music.
Under its protective cover the flight record will have a probable
lifetime of a billion years. It is unlikely that many other artifacts
of humanity will survive for so prodigious a period of time; it is clear,
for example, that most of the present continents will be ground down and
dissipated by then. Inclusion of the musical selections on the Voyager
record ensures for them a kind of immortality which could not be achieved
in any other way.
We would like you to be a member of the final musical selection

Carl Engel, Esq.
3 East 43rd Street,
New York. 

Dear Mr. Engel:

On your request I saw yesterday the Fairchild people, with
reference to sound reproduction machines to be used in recording folk-songs, 
and for my purposes to be used where there are no possible electric connec-
tions. In other worlds, the machine must be operated by batteries. Such a 
machine the Fairchilds offered to build within three weeks time at a cost of 
$475. It will weigh about 300 lbs. Should they also build a platform for 
carrying the machine in the back of an automobile, the total cost would be
$500. The Fairchilds furnished a machine of this type to Prof. De Onise of
Columbia University, and Prof. Schindler of Bennington College, for recording 
folk-songs in Spain. Mr. Garwick claims that 200 successful recordings were 
made. 

I visited the Amplion people this morning. They asked me
$495 for a similar machine complete, the chief difference being that their 
machine weights less than 100 lbs. The Amplion people inform me that Dr. 
Greet of the English Department of Columbia University has in use an outfit
purchased from them that has given entire satisfaction. They also claim
that New York University has recently purchased a machine. 

Both of these companies gave me satisfactory evidence that 
their machines operate successfully, both in recording and reproducing
singing, when such a recording is done under the favorable conditions of 
their own equipment and expert operation. I did not have an opportunity 
of hearing any records played that had been made under field conditions. 

I am deeply grateful for your very kind interest in my work 
and the constant courtesy you have shown me. 

Sincerely yours, 
John A. Lomax  [?]

P.S. For your information, a letter addressed to me in care of General
Delivery, Albany, New York, will reach me any time for a week. After that, 
I shall be at the University of Texas, Austin, Texas. 

P.P.S. Prof. De Onise tells me the machine was entirely satisfactory.

Mr. John A. Lomax,
University of Texas,
Austin, Texas.

Dear Sir:

     I have secured the order from the Atlas for a 
battery operated recording instrument and I hope to be able to duplicate it for you.  I have seen Mr. Engel and he will advise me as soon as word comes from Washington to proceed.  Since I talked with you Fairchild has stiffly increased the prices of all instruments much against my will 
- their battery portable now is $600 and as our ideas of policy and construction are getting farther apart every day 
I have decided to sever my connections with them.  Every improvement in their instrument has directly come about through me and my efforts and I have already given them much 
of the specifications for the instrument which I will agree to build for you for $450.00 including batteries.  If you wish to provide your own batteries, deduct $30.00 (see specifications 
for description) I will have as my technical staff the engineers at the studio where I took you.  These men are recognized as being 
at the very top and are called in or have been by the other manufacturers of recording instruments.  They have a reputation 
for making the best metal and wax records in this city.  Part of the equipment which I propose to use has been in constant 
use there for many months.

     The objection that I have always had to the Fairchild portable in size, weight and power will be eliminated as the 
weight of each of the two cases will almost be cut in half 38 to 45 pounds instead of 70 to 75 lbs.  The size of the case will be 17 x 17 x 16, about 2/3 of the Fairchild size.

     I can not cut the weight of the batteries except to cut the quality of the recording.  I am, however, using the same batteries as with the Fairchild or other standard 
set despite that fact that I will provide an amplifier with at least 4 times that of the Fairchild set.

If you use one 6 volt wet battery you will have 20 hours of recording - two will give you more satisfaction and about 40 hours.  You could carry a small trickle charger and one battery and keep it charged up to full capacity.

You will need 180 volts of B battery and these will 
last a long, long time.  On my new outfit you maycut either celluloid or metal and you will get 20% more on every disc 
than on any other standard instrument as it will cut 120 lines to 
the inch in metal discs.  In changing from metal to

celluloid only the cutting head is changed - - - takes about 2 minutes. Celluloid cutting calls for a little more skill but is the coming method. There are many features for convenience and better recording that will be included that
will not be found on any other instrument. I have travelled
about 30,000  miles during this past year with various kinds of portable recorders - starting out with a bulky one in a
large wooden box to the present type of Fairchild and I have
demonstrated -recorded and played records in every conceivable
place and in the meantime have been constantly at work
designing and improving these recording instruments and I
believe that, with the engineering talent and facilities
which I will have at work for me that no one is in better
position for producing your instrument. The men who sit
behind desks in factories are needed of course, but they
have no conception of what is needed out in the field.

I will have specifications on weight, size and power
and a N. Y. office in a few days. In the meantime would
you like to give it a name? What would be a classic name
for echo or reproduction? I will greatly welcome your
suggestion I have guaranteed the Atlas the finest recorder
for this type of work and they have dealt long enough with
me to believe that I can do this without any question. I
have been handicapped heretofore with antiquated equipment
that had to be used up but now I am free to build with the
latest material and ideas.

Already this set is the fastest selling and so far
it is going only to the professional trade, such as the
studios, you visited, the radio station etc.

Later I may be compelled to make a slight raise in
price because I am giving far more than any other manufacturer.
The amplifier alone will cost many times the
one in the Fairchild and similar jobs but that is the
boiler works and where quality should begin.

Mr. Carl Engel,

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have received two long letters from 
Mr. Garwick.  I am handing you herewith a copy of 
the last one.

Among the men I interviewed while in 
New York, this man impressed me as the most dependable 
because he has had the actual experience with 
trying out the recording machines under all sorts 
of road difficulties.  Of course, he has something 
to sell and wants to sell it.  You will notice that 
he has made a substantial reduction in price over 
what has been quoted.  Another important and favorable 
change is in the weight of the machine, which 
must be carried in a light car, because we will travel 
far away from concrete pavements.

You are busy with ten thousand other 
calls on your time; but I do wish that you would 
write and let me know what prospects you have found 
of securing a machine for my use this summer as I 
travel back to Washington.  To freshen your mind 
again, I plan to visit the chain gang camps of 
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and the negro 
districts of New Orleans, Vicksburg, Memphis and 
St. Louis and any other of the river towns that 
seem worth while, stopping at as I journey by river 
steamer from New Orleans to St. Louis.  Of course, 
I expect to find interesting voices in the groups 
of negro workers on the steamboats on which I travel, 
as well as among the negro roust-a-bouts at the 
places where we stop en route.

I again assure you of my deep appreciation 
of  your courtesy and kindness during my stay 
in Washington.

University of Texas Station
Austin, Texas

My dear Mr. Lomax:

My note of May 27 was not in reply to yours of May 24, which I received
only this morning. The letter of May 19, from Mr. Garwick - of which you sent
me a copy - confirms what I understood him to say when I last saw him in New
York.

As I wrote to you, I expect to have a talk with him in about a week. I have
yet to learn how long it will take him to complete the machine for the Library.

If you have settled on a definite date for the beginning of your tour,
your letter does not reveal it. Other important information is where to ship
the machine when it is ready, whether to Austin or to some place near the spot
where you propose to begin your recording. It would seem wiser, however, to
send the machine to you where you can test it before you go on the road, and
have any possible fault corrected before you are in the field.

Do I understand you to say that you would be motoring all the way to Washington
and deliver the machine to us on your arrival?

What about records? Will you provide them? Shall we provide them? What
kind do you propose to use? Aluminum or celluloid?

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music

Your note of May 30 reached me this morning in New York. I had a talk yesterday afternoon with Mr. Garwick. He showed me photographs of the machine he proposes to build. His promises sound rather hopeful, and I trust he will realize them. I am to get the specifications within a day or two. Meanwhile, I have told him that we definitely want him to build us a machine and he assured me that he would lose no time. However, even with the utmost speed, it will probably take at least two weeks to have the machine in readiness. Then their remains the shipping of it to Texas, which will probably mean another three or four days. There-fore, it might be safe to say that the machine cannot possibly be in your hands for another three weeks.

Your note still fails to disclose whether the forwarding address given in it is also the one to which you would want the machine expressed.

My dear Mr. Lomax:

Three days ago, while in New York, I had Mr Garwick show me the machine. He 
tested it thoroughly in my presence, I spoke and sang a few little snatches into 
the mike myself, and gained the impression that, if properly handled, the machine 
should give excellent results.

I was more impressed with the recording on aluminum discs than on celluloid. 
But I understand that the celluloid records have certain advantages over the metal 
ones; they are certainly lighter and probably more easily handled.

I have this morning received a letter with shipping instructions. I am forwarding 
these at once to Mr. Garwick. There remain a few finishing touches to be applied 
to the machine, but he promised to have it ready for shipment by July 3 or 5.  
This should bring it to Baton Rouge in time for your arrival there about July 10. 
I presume that, if need be, you would find there some radio technician or electrician 
who could help you to set up the machine. Mr Garwick intends to send not only full 
directions, but also a wiring plan, so that any mechanician can see at a glance how 
the machine works and where every part can be found. The test records will be sent 
to you in Austin and can probably be forwarded from there. Mr. Garwick's address in 
New York is 250 West 54th Street.

Naturally, I shall be anxious for a word from you that this machine was safely 
received and is giving satisfactory service. With every wish for your enterprise 
and kind regards, I am

Dear Mr. Lomax:   
I regret very much my delay in answering your letter
of January 24, which reached me at State College; but an
attack of illness, which struck me shortly before your letter
arrived, so ""slowed me up"" that it was all I could do to
keep my required work going for the rest of the school year.
I neglected everything but schoolwork and my correspondence
with my family.
In the part of country where I have been finding the
material I have, the great bulk of the folksongs are of
British origin - as is the case, I presume, in most early-settled
""singing districts"". However, I have recovered quite a
few of the indigenous pieces to which your special study is
directed. A number of them certainly must be quite widely
known, as I see versions of them in most collections that
I chance to look into; and I have no doubt but what you
are acquainted with them all, and perhaps have far better texts
in your collection than any I have been able to recover.
I shall list the native songs in my collection which
seem to be widely known - or, at least, which I personally
have found in collections from different parts of the country.

Poor Omie
The Jealous Lover
      (Pearl Bryan)
Banks of the O-hi-O
     (old Pedee)
Dying Cowboy
St. James's Hospital
     (The Unfortunate Girl)
Springfield Mountain
The Man Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn
The Texas Ranger
Sam Bass
Bill Stafford
James Bird (only a fragment, with air)
The Dying Californian
Brother Green
The Rebel Soldier
The Bright, Sunny South
McAfee's Confession

When I was One-and-Twenty

Drunkard's Doom
Lonesome Dove
In old Virginia
     (Title fr. Sharp Eng. FSS from the
                Southern appalachians)
Little Mohee
The Wreck on the C&O (fragment, with air)
The Single Girl
Colonel
In Eighteen Hundred and Sixty-One
Liza Jane [?]
The Frozen Girl
The Gambling Man

I think all these pieces are
indigenous, tho' I am no scholar
who can trace them to their sources.
But I know you are well acquainted
with all of them.

text\afc1933001_ms006_005.txt,"I have other songs which are certainly indigenous, but 
about their currency and popularity throughout the country,
I know absolutely nothing. There is one called ""Mary Brade"",
which commences:
The stars are out, the moon is bright,
and the lark is singing free x (!)
come listen while I sing about 
My old brown coat and me.

IT is a story of a ""proud beauty"" who rejected her poor suitor, and 
married a rich one , to her grief.

Another song, of Civil War times, is on the theme of a dying 
soldier's last words. It contains the lines:
O soldier, soldier, when I am gone, 
Oh, write a letter to my home, 
And tell my mother she must not mourn
For Elvie Dore, her eldest-born.

I am quoting from these songs because I fancied that they
might be widely current, and known to you; and a quotation might
enable you to identify them at once. I myself, as I've already
said, am totally ignorant of how well or widely they may 
be known.

Another song, called ""Dunharden"", is the history of a horse thief.
It has these lines:
I courted for my jewel my own heart's delight,
Till I stole a fine black horse from a Mr. William White,
They follow'd me up, they did me betray,
And they carried me off home to the penitentiary.

A song about a gambler's farewell and lament begins:
Farewell, kind friends, I'm going to leave you;
Perhaps you'll think I'm doing wrong,
But Nature binds this life to ramble,
And leave the home where I've lived so long.

Another lament begins:
There was a young woman in the bloom of life,
Her age it was sixteen.
She was call'd by death and had to go,
And leave a many a friend.

There is also one called ""Bummers' Hotel"", and one called ""the little boy on 
Market Square"", which seem to be of American make. And I have one 
called ""The Bear in the Hill"", which has to do with the courtship and

I forgot to mention one which is known outside my district,
and which seems to be indigenous. My version begins:
Young Paddy's sore diggin' taters in the sand,
Brogues on his feet and a shovel in his hand.
He went down the street as hard as he could run,
and all he could say was, Johnny, git your gun,
Mushy ding!

It is about a boy who enlisted, and the equipment he received! In 
my part of the country it is called ""The Irish Potato"".

There are songs in my collection that I don't know whether
to label ""indigenous"" or not.  They might be of native make, and
they might also be of some late Anglo-Irish composition.   Such a one
is this, which you probably know about, tho' I don't. It is 
rather widely known; in the Appalachians, at any rate:
Come all you maids of a rambling nature, 
Come listen to my mournful song,
I loved a fair one beyond my duty;
I suffered more than the common run.

Another one of this sort is the following,— I'll give a stanza out of 
the middle:
I think it's high time to leave off the lads,
And commence on the ladies - they're four times as bad.
They'll powder their face and comb up their hair,
Like an owl in the bush at the boys they will stare.

The refrain, as I have heard it, is: ""Derry down, down, hi derry down"", or 
""Li-o, li-o, ladl-i-o!""

I have a few compositions, also, that were made in my own
particular part of the country, and were very popular there about 
forty years ago. Like most of our folksongs of comparatively recent
date, these are either laments or satires. I think it very improbable
that they have attained any wider currency than in the southwestern 
corner of Pennsylvania, and the neighboring counties of 
West Virginia. One of them  is a lament for a murdered girl. It 
begins: 
Come all you good people, wherever you be, 
Come listen a while to my sad tragedy.

at the age of nineteen she ended her days.

Likewise, there is a lament for a murdered cattle-drover, and 
for a volunteer who was lost in the civil war. there are 
satires on two families who – to judge by the songs – must have 
been feeble-minded.

I have heard and recorded some ""play-party"" songs, but know so 
little about that type of folksong that I can say nothing about it.
Some of them I have chanced to see in old-country collections, 
and the rest may be all imported from Great Britain too: they 
are all alike in style, as far as I can see.

Of the camp-meeting songs and spirituals in my collection 
I know next to nothing – that is, nothing about how widely 
current most of them may have been. Some of them I have seen 
in collections from the Appalachians and Ozarks; most of them 
are unknown to me outside of the districts where I got them. 
A few that are apparently known over a rather wide area are:
The Poor Wayfaring Stranger
The Lost Youth
Wicked Polly
The Little Scholar (or: Shepherd)
The Little Family in Bethany
We Have fathers in the Promised Land
On the Other Shore
Power in Jesus' Blood
The Power of the Lord is Coming down
Will the Waters Be Chilly?

Perhaps you can get an idea, from these rather ""scattering"" remarks, 
of the number and types of indigenous songs that I have found 
in the course of collecting during the past three summers. I am sure 
you will agree that the ones given in my first list are so widely 
known as to be familiar to every collector. The others I have quoted 
or referred to might well belong to the same category – but you know 
far more about that than I. The indigenous pieces in my collection are a
very small part of the whole, which consists mostly of the old British songs, 
versions of which are found all over the country.
  If there are any of these songs about which you wish to have 
more details, I shall be glad to tell you what I know – which isn't 
much, but might possibly prove helpful or interesting in your study. 
I will quite frankly admit that my interest is centered more on music 
than on texts, and that the imported old-country songs absorb me 
more than the American-made ones; which I have noted down simply 
as a matter of duty and record, as a collector should. I am not blind, 
however, to the value of specialized study of these native products; and 
if any details I can furnish you will aid in the solving of problems 
connected with indigenous folksong, I shall be only too glad to
furnish them.
Yours very sincerely, 
Sam P. Bayard

Mr. John A. Lomax
% Professor Ives,
Dept. of Education,
Barton Rouge La.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
I have just returned from Boston, where Idelivered a duplicate
of your instrument to the Linguistic Atlas people. I believe that 
these two instruments have made the finest records, both on metal
and celluliod, that I have ever heard.

I hope ere this that you are making good records yourself. I
am awaiting with much interest a sample of your recording, after
you had the new stylus and the correct microphone in use.

Yesterday I stopped in to see the Edison Battery people to learn
something more about those batteries, I enclose a booklet that
should be useful to you.

I also wish to advise that it is best to allow for the needle
load when testing the turntable speed. Press your finger slightly
aginst the turntable when testing and that should compensate for the
needle load. If you do not allow for the needle load your records
will be made at slightly lower speed than 78 R. P. M. and when you
play back at 78 R. P. M. the pitch will be a little higher. I also
found out that the regular automobile batteries for the same power
as the Edison type would weigh in excess of 200 lbs. as gainst the
130 lbs. for the Edison.

I can build an attachment for using this instrument with A. C.
current for $75. It would be necessary for you to change the motor
each time, but that is rather easy. I am building this for the Atlas
people. You will find it a great convenience quite often.

I can also supply a 6 ampere Tungar battery charger at the wholesale
price of $16.80 (this is my cost ); retail price is $24. this
will fully charge your batteries in about 35 hours. Please let me
know how you are getting along ,for I can read a lot from a sample
record.

There is no doubt that you have one of the two finest recording
sets in the country, and that is not only of my opinion, but of the
expert sound engineers, who have heard it.

           The volume that we put on the records has caused the engineers, in the
studio where you visited, to make changes on the Fairchild cutting heads ( they
have four of these ) to obtain a corresponding volume.

           Do not forget that I would like to have any information about length of

it does not cover any of the new materials, which only we have used, it will be

New Orleans, Louisiana

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I received this morning your letter of July 19th, from Baton
Rouge, with Mr. Garwick's letter enclosed. I am much distressed
to hear that the machine is not giving immediate satisfaction, and
I am particularly disappointed, because the tests to which the
machine was subjected in my presence in New York, and the recordings
which I myself made, seemed to indicate a remarkable degree
of perfection. Mr. Garwick picked up radio music, and I spoke
and sang into the machine. When played back, the discs gave a
very true and smooth performance, though the metal discs seemed to
me possibly preferable to the celluloid ones. I am sure that Mr.
Garwick will, in his own interest, see that the machine is put into
working condition. His willingness to join you in Memphis should
be a guaranty.

As regards the weight of the machine, I understand that it
does not exceed the specifications, but, if anything, is slightly
less. Apparently any machine, dependent on batteries, weighs more
than one fed on light current. I understand, however, that you
felt a battery machine was necessary because of the likelihood of
your wanting to use it in places where light current could not be
had.

I am most grateful to you for your interest and for your
prompt and minute reports. I trust that you will keep me informed
about the progress you are making with the recordings. In the
meantime, I am holding up Mr. Garwick's voucher until I get more
encouraging news from you.

With kindest regards and best wishes for the ultimate success
of your trip, I am

The American Ballad

BY JOHN A. LOMAX

Address: University of Texas Station,
Austin, Texas

Author of ""Cowboy Songs"" and ""Songs of the Cattle Trail""; for three
years Sheldon Fellow for the Investigation of American Ballads; twice
President of the American Folklore Society; one of the organizers
and the first Secretary of the Texas Folklore Society.

1. The Songs of the Cowboy
2. Negro ""Spirituals""
3. Songs of the ""Worl'ly"" Negro
4. Cowboy Verse
5. Types of the American Ballad

THESE LECTURES are popularized abridgements of papers read before the
Modern Language Association of America. Much of the material used
has never appeared in print, and Mr. Lomax endeavors to interpret the
spirit of the Folk-Songs by sympathetic recital and singing rather than by
a conventional lecture. Audiences throughout the United States have been
surprised to discover that much genuine poetry has remained buried and
unnoticed in these rough ballads of our own people. In the hope that
these changing songs may all be recorded before they disappear, wherever
he goes, Mr. Lomax seeks conferences with those who know Folk-Songs.
These lectures are offered singly or in series.

PROFESSOR G. L. KITTREDGE, Harvard University:
""Few lectures delivered at our University have been so successful. The students, as
you must have seen, were delighted, and the members of the Faculty who were present
were equally interested.""

PROFESSOR WILLIAM LYON PHELPS, Yale University:
""Every moment of the hour was interesting; he succeeds to a high degree in combining
definite instruction with continuous entertainment.""

DEAN L. B. R. BRIGGS, Harvard University:
""Every member of the modern language conference that I have met has expressed
real pleasure in hearing your paper the other night. The more colleges that get a
chance at your lectures the better.""

CARL SANDBURG:
""I think no one delivers the cowboy songs with the reality, the truth to life, that
is heard in the Lomax renditions. He gets their stride and stridency, and their rough
tang.""

PROFESSOR L. E. BASSETT, Stanford University, California:
""Our audience was delighted with the vivid glimpses of the life of the cowboy and
the striking description and rendition of cowboy songs.""

PROFESSOR ARTHUR C. L. BROWN, Northwestern University, Evanstan, Ill.""
""John A. Lomax's reading and lecture entitled Negro Spirituals was highly successful
and entertaining. The students would go to hear him again if they had the chance,
I am sure.""

PROFESSOR HERBERT E. GREEN, Johns Hopkins University:
""At the University and at church today I have heard favorable comments on the
lecture from people of various ages, tastes, and callings.""

PROFESSOR REED SMITH, University of South Carolina:
"" 'Best thing I ever heard in that old chapel,' is a comment several students have
made to me.""

PROFESSOR LEWIS F. MOTT, College of the City of New York:
""The students showed the most intense interest from beginning to end, and many
spoke to me afterwards of the pleasure and profit they had derived from this presentation
of a phase of American life.""

PROFESSOR FREDERICK TUPPER, JR., University of Vermont:
""Professor Lomax's genial address upon 'Cowboy Songs' made such a delightful
impression upon us all that, for the past month, refrains and choruses of the ranches
have been humming in our heads, and certain phrases of the plains bid fair to become
proverbial among us.""

J. C. SEEGARS, Dean of Temple University, Philadelphia:
""Both faculty members and students have expressed enthusiastic appreciation to me
and we feel that your visit was a distinct contribution. We hope to have you again
next year.""

PROFESSOR FRANK C. BROWN, Trinity College, North Carolina:
""All who heard you here-Faculty, students and friends alike-were greatly pleased
with your lectures.""

PROFESSOR J. W. TUPPER, Lafayette College:
""We get a picture complete of the Cowboy life and all its emotions. Even the free,
easy, open-hearted style of the songs pictures just such a life on the broad plains of the
great Southwest:
""If the ocean was whiskey and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom to get one sweet sup.""

PROFESSOR S. M. TUCKER, Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn:
""Perhaps the pleasantest evening of our college year was Professor Lomax's lecture
on 'Cowboy Songs and Ballads.' I have never seen a more interested audience.""

PRESIDENT R. E. BLACKWELL, Randolph-Macon College, Ashland, Va.:
""The students are still talking about the questions that your lectures raised, and your
visit has done good in turning the interest to the subject of our ballads.""

PRESIDENT CHARLES C. THACH, Alabama Polytechnic Institute:
""It was in every way a delightful event, keenly enjoyed every minute by the large
audience. It seemed like a genuine echo from the Western prairie.""

PRESIDENT A. H. UPHAM, Miami UNiversity, Ohio:
""It has been my privilege thrice to present him to student audiences, who have
received him most enthusiastically and clamored for his return.""

PROFESSOR M. ELLOWRRD SMITH, Oregon State College:
""Your songs furnish lecture material in a class by itself. Quite beyond the mere
humor of many of them, it is their fundamental human nature which takes the
audiences.""

PROFESSOR EDWIN F. SHEWMAKE, Davidson College, N. C.:
""Students, professors and townspeople were captivated by the way in which you
revealed the romantic charm, the pathos and the humor of cowboy life as reflected in
the songs.""

DEAN J. O. CREAGER, University of Arizona.
""To say that his Harvard and Yale sponsorship was fully justified would be to speak
tamely. Our students and faculty pronounced him the best of the season, and we had
an extensive and varied program of lecturers and entertainers.""

GEORGE M. MILLER, Professor of English, University of Idaho:
""Of all men who have been students of the great ballad authorities, I believe that
you have done more than any other to increase the general interest in folk song.""

JOHN W. BARTON, Vice-President, Ward-Belmont School, Nashville, Tenn.:
""I am writing this to tell you just how thoroughly our girls enjoyed your recent
visit here, and what a rare treat they received from your lecture on the cowboy and
his songs. You are keeping alive in a very fine way one of the real American traditions.""

H.Y. Benedict, President University of Texas:
""Out of a great and authentic mass of material he selects with admirable judgement that which is amusing, interesting, and instructive.  Despite the patience with which he has amassed his sources, his cowboy stuff bears not the brands of the closed study but of the open ranges.""
E.D. Jennings, Dean of Southern Methodist University:
""I was immediately struck with your natural, pleasing and effective voice and found myself surprised at your ability to imitate the cowboys not only in their songs, but also in their crooning and whooping.  I never fully realized the poetic beauty of the songs until I heard you repeat them with such accuracy and melody.""
Mrs. Karle Wilson Baker, Nacogdoches, Texas:
""Few programs that I have heard carry so rich a content in so happy a vehicle of pure entertainment.""
T.D. Hobart, President Panhandle-Plains Historical Society:
""I do not think that I halfway expressed to you the appreciation of our Society for the wonderful assistance you gave at the banquet of the Pandhandle-Plains Historical Society.""
J. Frank Dobie, English Department, University of Texas:
""Lomax is doing for the balladry of America what one Percy did for the ballad literature of Britain.  And as Percy remains the ballad curator of Britain, so does Lomax retain his preeminence as preserver of American folk-poetry.""
L.H. Hubbard, President of the Texas State College for Women, Denton:
""You gave us a new conception of the importance of ballad literature in the Southwest, and the artistic manner in which you presented the subject recreated for your listeners the life on the plains in a peculiarly vivid manner.""
Mrs. T. A. Armstrong, President of the Waco Press Club:
""Hard-riding centaurs, herding migrating cattle among the cacti, gallop across imagination's stage so plainly that it becomes unbelievable that they are conjured up by the professional gentleman who stands talking alone behind the lecture table in wing collar and drawing-room clothes.""
E. E. Davis, Dean of the North Texas Agricultural College:
""I have heard dozens of students and practically all of the faculty people express their appreciation for the fine entertainment you gave.  It went over as a one hundred percent success.""
Cullen P. Thomas, Dallas:
""For three-quarters of an hour, without a dull moment, I was charmed with your interpretation of cowboy life and literature.""
Sam Acheson, in Dallas News:
""His appearances in forty-three states and in most of the important universities have earned John A. Lomax an enviable reputation as an interpreter of perhaps the saltiest and most vital of all American folk art.""

Dear Mr. Engel:

I met Mr. Lorax last week in New York, and we talked over many things, he asked
me to have the recording instrument returned here for checking over etc.  This
morning I received a letter from him, written in West Virginia, confirming this.
I have asked the Return Loads Bureau to pick up the instrument complete as follows:
1 case recording unit                                          [*1 Dictaphone No 14744 O*]

1 case 3 cells of Edison Batteries
1 case 3 cells of Edison Batteries
1 microphone suspended on stand
1 50 feet lenghth of cable.

A copy of this letter goes to the Return Loads Bureau. They will have a truck leaving Washington for New York on Monday and another later in the week. They will handle everything very carefully, especially the microphone. I trust this action meets with your approval.

I have not been able to get to Washington to give your organization a demonstration, but will do this sometime with one of my regular instruments.

I have not been able to find the metal record you made at the studio, but have found the one made on celluloid. I am going to make another search for it however, and if it  is found, I will deliver it to your New York office.

Very truly yours,
W.C. Garwick

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The machine, records, and all that goes with it, have been sent
to Mr. Garwick in New York. It was my belief that you were going
to make further tests under Mr. Garwick's supervision. He does not
think that he can come to Washington in the immediate future.

Naturally, I want you to use the machine, if it helps to procure 
records for the Library. At this moment I do not quite see out 
of what fund or appropriation we can cover the charges for transportation 
to Texas,  but I'll look into it. I presume you will let me
have a definite address by return mail. 

I am supposed to see Mr. Leland one of these days, but since a 
date has not yet been set for our interview and it may suffer delay,
you might write to him directly, telling him what you have in mind,
also pointing out the interest that the Linguistic Atlas people are
taking in out Archive of American Folk-Song.

It seems to me that your letter of Nov. 18 must have consisted 
of more than two sheets. I can not see any connection between the
bottom of the first and the top of the second. This may have resulted
in my reply being vague and incomplete.

any necessary explanations?
President Newcomb of the University of

Dear Mr Engel:

Our recent trip to South Texas
convinces me that our work will
be greatly helped if we had the additional
equipment necessary to operate your
machine both by direct and by alternating 
current. Another appliance will enable
us to fill our batteries without delay or
expense. Then we should have convenient caps
built into our car so as to carry the
various parts of the recording machine
without damage, and with much added convenience.
If my to request could be
added $250, the sum would be ample.
Merry Christmas and Thanks, John A. Lomax

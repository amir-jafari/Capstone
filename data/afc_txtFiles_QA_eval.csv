TRAVEL.
The road got littler and littler until it just nachully run up a tree.
COMPARISONS.
So Dutch that he has sauerkraut hanging out of his ears.
Fascinating as a loose tooth.
Green as Kelly's necktie.
Handy as a cow with a musket, handy as a hog with a fiddle.
Independent as a hog on ice.
Long as a country block, longer than an Irishman's dream, longer than a
moral law, longer than a yard of pumpwater.
Out and gone like Riley's eye.
So slow you can watch the snails whiz by. Slow as a buck maggot.
A bag full of flour and a purse full of money are the best relations in the
world.
He put a lot of church work into it.
It's a poor job that can't afford one boss.
THRIFT.
Pare the cheese pretty close to the rind.
There are men who would skin a louse for its tallow.
A woman can throw out on a spoon more than her man can bring in on a shovel.
Reach for the high apples first, you can get the low ones any timel
IGNORANCE.
He doesn't know twice around a broomstick.
He doesn't know enough to pull in his head when he shuts the window.
He doesn't know enough to suck alum and drool.
Let not your tongue cut your throat.

April 7, 1941

The Macmillan Co. Inc.
60 Fifth Avenue
New York, N.Y.

Gentlemen:

On page 361 of your work entitled ""American Ballads and
Folk Songs"" collected and compiled by John A. Lomax and Alan
Lomax, issued in 1934, you print the words and the music of a 
musical composition entitled ""Alla En El Rancho Grande"", the
copyright on which is owned by my client Edward B. Marks
Music Corporation.

A note on the same page indicates that you have taken
the extract from the ""Texas Folk Lore Society"". Mr. J. Frank
Dobie of the Texas Folk Lore Society advises me that at the
time he used the portion of the song he was not aware that
it was a copyrighted song.

I have not until now called you to account on behalf of
my client for the printing of the song on the ground that you
had taken it in good faith from Mr. Dobie's publication. I
now understand that Mr. John A. Lomax or Mr. Alan Lomax is
disseminating the information that the song in question is in
the public domain. The contrary is the truth, for the song was
first published with a United States notice of copyright in
1927 and was duly registered at the Copyright Office at Wash-
ington. The statements of Mr. Lomax are damaging the song and
my client.

Since you are the publishers of the volume containing a
portion of the song, I call upon you to secure and submit to
me proof that the song is in the public domain or the grounds
upon which Mr. Lomax bases his statements. I desire that you
submit this material to me within one week or prevail upon
Messrs. Lomax to cease slandering my client. If the material
I request is not submitted to me within a week or if in the
alternative you do not assure me that Messrs. Lomax will
cease the slanderous and damaging statements I shall be com-
pelled to bring an action against you for infringement, since
neither you nor Mr. Dobie had authority to print the portion
of the song contained in the respective books.

Very sincerely yours,
A. E. Garmaize

Dear Mr. Lomax:

As you know by now, a new machine was already sent you 
by the time your letter arrived.  Your arguments (and many others) 
in favor of a 16"" turntable had already been thoroughly gone into 
but the unanimous opinion was that the smaller machine was more 
suitable for the immediate needs of the Archive.  The new Presto 
has a two-speed motor.  We made every effort to get you a machine 
as soon as possible.  In fact, if your first report had been 
adequate, you would have had the machine by now.

I am very much concerned over your vagueness as to your 
whereabouts.  When the enclosed letter was returned today, I 
thought it best to call Mr. Alsberg.  He kindly promised to wire the Detroit headquarters to hold the machine for you.  Your last 
letter gives absolutely no indication of your present address.

I have not been able to read your report carefully as yet 
but it looks quite interesting.  I cannot tell yet how much of 
it can be printed but even if it has to be cut, I am glad to have 
the complete report for our files.

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the Archive of American Folk-Song
Division of Music, Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.
Dear Dr. Lomax:
I am writing a rather belated acknowledgement of your letter of December 20, 
in which you gave instructions for the use of the duplicate recordings[.]
of parts of three of the Amish hymns.  I received the record and used it
in connection with my talk before the American Folk-Lore Society in New
York on December 30.  I thank you very much for your courtesy and assure
you that we will do all in our power to assist you in further recordings.
I am not sure, however, that any other recordings will be possible here in 
northern Indiana.  We may need to choose some other section.  I have not
entirely given up hope of doing further recording here, but it will be
necessary to overcome a considerable amount of reluctance if we shall be
able to do any more recording here.
I am sorry that the young cub who reported the last meeting of the
American Folk-Lore Society made so many mistakes.  It was quite inexcusable,
because at his request I had given him the manuscript copy of my address.
You may have noticed that he said that the recordings had been made by
 a Northwestern University student.  What I [had] said was that you had made 
the recordings and that a Northwestern University student was making an
intensive study of the hymns under expert guidance.  the Northwestern
University School of Music may write to you for copies of the records
which you have.  If so, I should be glad to have the records made available
to them.
I  [T]hank you again for your cooperation and courtesy and hope that we may
meet sometime and continue the recording of Amish hymns.
Very cordially yours,

besides being the most prevalent, the most dangerous

leads to the conclusion that it is dangerous to print or repeat
a hate rumor in any form, even in order to deny it. (See page 16.)
The purpose of a hate rumor is to spread hatred, to make a given
group a scapegoat. The denial of specific hate rumors does not
spike the hate which created the rumor but tends to shift the hate
to different ""facts"" or different rumors. Hate rumors should never
be repeated or printed by themselves --even in order to be denied--

to decide.  And there are a lot of young people here in the Cajun country now 
who have been following that precept.  Who, who have been sitting at the feet of 
the great old time Cajun musicians and learning just how to do it.  And we have, 
I want to hear Mike Doucet who is the leader of per, perhaps the most popular 
and best known and, and one of the most beautiful of all the, of all the young 
[people's orchestras] [? plays all over] here, the, his band is going to, goes to Paris, goes to New
DOUCET  [UNCLEAR]
LOMAX  And Mike is going to tell us how he developed his musicianship
and what's going on with the young musicians.
DOUCET  [UNCLEAR]  Well I guess I, I'm really fortunate for coming around
on Cajun music when I did.  It must have been about 1969 or '70 when we got,
we knew Doug [Kirshald] was playing out there in Macon but somehow that didn't settle
for us right here.  And so it was our intention in those days, our group, 
[Beausoleil], to go and learn from the older musicians.
In those days, in the early '70s, there was hardly any young people who
were playing it.  They were playing Cajun music.  It was mostly a Nashville influence. 
And they were also playing accordian music.  They weren't that many fiddle 
music.  And to me that was a great problem because our music, the Arcadian music 
had always been string music.  And I have nothing against the accordian but 
after the accordian came into prominance after the late '50s again, then the role 
of the fiddle got to be second, or [FRENCH].
So it was my intention to go out and find some people.  I live around this
area.  This is around Scott.  And I knew people like Hector [Dujon] and Doc [Gidre], 
who had played.  And, and but that was their own style.  And then all of
a sudden coming to light with Dewey [Balfor] living out there in Basile, that was
a completely different style that they didn't have here.  So what I did is like
put in my mind that if I'm going to play this music I'm going to have to learn
it.  And the thing about it is I couldn't learn from one person because I had
to learn all the styles.  And amazing thing about Cajun music is it, Arcadians are
people that came from France.  The ingredient that I found most intriguing, most 
exotic about it that I felt the deepest down in me was the blues.
And that, that led me to one of the greatest musicians that I've ever known,
Canray Fontenot from [Welsh], you know.  Canray Fontenot, he was there at the
right time in the right place.  He comes from a family of musicians.  His father,
[Norcadon], as he was called, was a first class accordian player, the same
league as [Armaday] [UNCLEAR].  But with [UNCLEAR], he had strong values and virtues.
And it was his idea that when he died he didn't want to leave anything here, 
pictures nor music.  So when he died he just, Canray was the only one that carried 
that sound on to us.  Canray portrays in his style, I guess something that
nobody else does because he can play Louisiana blues, Louisiana jazz, Louisiana
French, Cajun French, Caribbean French, all of that in one song through his fingers.  
So with studying from Canray a little bit, like I [UNCLEAR] a little bit
of that.  Another. . .
LOMAX  What kind of a person do you think, feel he is?  Canray. I mean
how does he feel to you?  You've been with him a lot.
DOUCET  Canray is one of the strongest individuals I think I've found that,
that just he's a, he's a mentor to me.  He's someone who, who, how you say,
I mean it sounds corny but he passes time in space.  He can go back to any century
[or any time] [in the future and] just be there at the righ time.  And the way I described it, I 
mean when he plays he plays exact.  He plays what's right.  You can't describe 
how he plays.  But whatever he does it's perfect and to the point.  The way he c

Another person that I studied with who is an incredible person right now,
in 1983 he's 90 years old, is Dennis McGee, who lives in Unice.  He was one of
the first Cajun fiddlers to record as a Cajun duet, two fiddles with a, both [Sadie 
Korville] and [Adolf Thrusez].  Dennis plays the older style that hardly anybody
plays.  He plays a lot of reels and contradances, cotillians.  And the thing 
about Dennis, he was one of the first to record in 1928.  And now he plays the 
same style, the same scratches, the same way.  And he's one of my best friends. 
And he and Gladys, it's a pleasure to go over there.
Another person I've studied for is lesser known but not in, in skill.  And
he's Mr. Varice Cunnard, who wss originally an O'Connor, and they changed it
to Cunnard because he just speaks French now.  And he was to me like the [Stephan

start home alone, that they would call for them. I went so far as
to ask them what fact it was based on, and each one would say: ""So

be able to serve you.

""RUMOR -- A certain local draft board composed entirely of 
Jewish members had been outrageously lenient in deferring 
Jewish registrants. A vast majority of its inductees 
were Christians. The situation became so scandalous 
that a Catholic priest went to protest. He was insulted 
by a board member and finally beaten up. The FBI had to 
move in and close up the board. 

""FACT -- This is one version of probably the most widespread, 
persistent rumor that has been peddled around New York 
since Pearl Harbor. For the past two months it has sprung 
up in all five boroughs, with reference to dozens of draft 
boards. 

""Sometimes it appears in an Italian neighborhood and at 
others in an Irish. One variation is for a Protestant woman 
to appeal to a Catholic priest, who then intervenes and is 
rebuffed by the draft board.

Its inexhaustible variations alone show how fantastic the 
rumor is. According to one, received recently by the 
World-Telegram 110 inductees in the Fordham section of 
the Bronx stages a two-day sitdown strike until they 
forced their board to call a larger percentage of Jews. No 
such incident could be traced. 

""In an Italian section of Brooklyn, Draft Board 202 was 
supposed to have been closed after the priest from the 
Church of our Lady Guadalupe complained of favoritism. 
The Rev. Joseph McCormack, pastor of the Church repudiated 
the story as a complete falsehood. The fact is that 
80 percent of that particular board's registrant's are 
Italians, so its percentage of Italian inductees is naturally
 high. 

""Another common version, involving the alleged fist 
fight between a priest and draft board member, centers in 
Washington Heights. Here the church is invariably 
mentioned as the Church of the Good Shepherd. This last 
week it was retold in a postcard addressed to Mayor La Guardia 
at City Hall, and in a letter received by this paper from a 
shop foreman who said that 300 workers in the shop are 
talking about it. Both referred to the Church of the Good 
Shepherd.

""Inquiry at the Church of the Good Shepherd brought a reply 
from the secretary to the pastor, the Rev. John H. Sullivan, 
that ""there is no truth whatsoever to the story."" The 
rumor has been going around the neighborhood for weeks, she

The Best Servants of the Gestapo are Free Men not on the Pay Roll.

There are distant and hidden things that all persons of good
sense can know beyond doubt by the process of reasoning.

For example:  they know that shrewd leaders of the gestapo have
issued the following orders, or similar ones, to those who are training
men for sabotage in America.

""The American passion for publicity has once more served us
well by pointing out our mistakes, and hereafter our saboteurs
must be taught to avoid these blunders.

""They must not attempt to bribe members of the coast guarrd.
These men will accept the money in apparent good faith, but
they cannot be trusted.

""Our saboteurs must not be soft.  The four accosted by a lone
coast guard on the beach might have lived to carry out their
mission if they had killed him.  They were fooled by his
apparent stupidity and let him live.  It was a blunder that
must not be repeated.

""Saboteurs who smoke must be provided with American cigarettes.
The four stupid ones who were fooled by the coast guard made
the additional and inexcusable blunder of dropping butts of
German cigarettes on the beach.  We are especially grateful
to the Americans for calling out attention to this mistake.
We shall be more careful hereafter.

""Saboteurs who are caught must give their correct names.  When
these are made public by simple Americans, we know which
units must be replaced in order to have their objectives
achieved.  And since all captures are promptly reported, we
know which units escaped capture and therefore which methods
of landing are most successful.

""We need not fear America's counter-espionage or doubt the
good faith or discretion of our agents living in America.
If the method of capturing our saboteurs had been kept secret,
we would have had reason to believe that the FBI knows
our secrets or that some of our agents are not to be trusted.
Such suspicions would have handicapped our work.  But since
the Americans kindly revealed all details of the capture, we

     One day while recording Negro folk tunes in the Huntsville penitentiary,
Alan, my son and collaborator, and I met Father Finnegan. Later
we had lunch with him. He is an impressive man of middle age, a native
of Ireland. Manager Simmons had spoken of his unique service and we 
listened eagerly to his stories of life in the raw as he had found it.
     He told us that his appeal to the men about to die was to meet 
the situation bravely. With every door of hope closed, with every 
effort rendered futile, with death inevitable, they could do nothing
better than to meet the end calmly, without struggle or protest.
Further resistance was useless. Some would tell him their stories, and 
some who wished the consolation of the Church, would made full confession,
and receive whatever comfort the Church had to give. There
is no Catholic church in Huntsville. One night just before the hour
of his execution a condemned man made his final confession and asked
for absolution. The articles necessary could only be had in a neighboring

carnival means farewell to meet. It's the last time you can
kick the gong around before lent. And were they doing it.

You see that peaked hat there? You see those
masks? Well, that's what old Europe always did after the 
winter. They had a big celebration. There was so much, the
feeling they're being so much they had to literally beat the
devil out of each other. And that explains why this strange
habit of these men slapping each other around with ropes,
this is going on all over this area, northwest, in southwest
Louisiana now.

Carnival is a really French and Mediterranean 
Europe festival that goes back into the dark ages past any
knowing actually. It's basically a pagan feast permitted by
the church with somewhat ill grace. And, but the Cajuns
have made a new form of it. Descendants of ranchers and as
they are they put the festival on horseback. And they get 
up early in the morning, the band of people from a
neighborhood and make a circuit through the neighborhood
going to different houses of all their friends and asking
for a contribution to mardi gras. This of course happened
in old Europe when bands of poor people sang their way
through the, this fast. But these people ask for a
contribution. They, they, and the captain rides down to the
house because you dare not cross a Cajun border line without
permission. These people are very, very property conscious.

Dear Jim:
   I presume the reason I haven't heard from you about the
book is that Macmillan is engaged in deciding what the amount of
the advance will be?  Nevertheless, I trustfully enclose a few
pages of the last chapter, which will be the story of Jelly Roll
Morton, as told by himself.  It's very rough;  it's never even
been properly gone over for typographical errors.

   The order of the book as I now see it will begin with brief
sketches and with the longest story, that of Jelly Roll Norton.
Intermediate material will gradually grow in complexity, leading
up to the idea of a small biography made up entirely of material
from records.

   I have never received the two complimentary copies of the
book destined to me.  Will you send one of them to me and t he
other to Herbert Robbins, care of the Mathematics Department,
New York University.

Dear Ed:
Thanks for your note about the Dillards, whom I'll
catch.
On thinking the matter over, it seems to me that there's
no great advantage in the Sea Island group making the
Detroit date.  The money is not good, but besides that,
it means exposure for them to the nightclub situation,
and I'd rather they stayed out of that as long as possible.  
I am going to so advise them.
What can you tell me about plans for filming the group
at Fort Valley College?
All the best,

The first night after my grandmother told me to go, I went to the
theatre and saw a play where they sang a very sweet song entitled, ""Give
me Back My Dead Daughter's Child"".  I thought about how my mother had 
died and left me a motherless child and how dirty my uncle Nebiscot had
been.  I began to cry.  A motherless child and orphan left out in this
wide world to mourn.  You wouldn't believe it, but I was so dumb I didn't
even know how to rent a room.  Walked the streets all night till time 
for the train for Biloxi.  Went to my god-mother, who was a very fine woman,
Eulalie Echo.  I played in various little places but I never made
any money like I had in New Orleans.  One of them was the Flat Top in
Biloxi.  I stayed there until one night the owner was hit in the head
with a pool ball, which has made him crazy every since.  I began hanging
around with older boys, for I was beginning to think of myself as quite
a man.  They told me that you could be real man only if you could take
a half pint of whiskey, throw it to your mouth and drink the whole thing
straight down.  So, I tried it and was knocked out for three whole days.
Lay under the bed at my godmother's house all that time and they never
found me.  That ended me with whiskey entirely and I never took another
drink, except every so often.

For a while, I played for a white sporting house woman, named Mattie
Bailey.  Nobody but white came there, but it was a dangerous place.  Seemed 
like she rather trusted me, so she always kept me behind to close up
the place for her.  I was always the last man out and talk got around that
she was intimate with me.  One night, some of the bums and low riff-raff
decided to lynch me, but Mattie heard about it and got me out the back door
in time.  xxxxxxxxx  I decided it was time to leave for New Orleans.

            The extensive field staff of the Office of Price Administration 
has splendid potentialities as an instrument for
judging public reactions to price control, rationing, etc.

            O. P. A. has ten regional offices:

                        5. Cleveland       10. San Francisco

Field inspectors now total over 300 and will soon reach 1000.

            Dr. Harold F. Gosnell, University of Chicago political 
scientist, is engaged in training the field personnel.  He is 
willing to utilize the O. P. A. field staff as part-time interviewers 
for systematic surveys of public opinion.

            Dr. Gosnell has had twenty years of professional experience 
in the field of public opinion polling.  He is willing to 
accept directive policy suggestions from this office. 

            Gosnell has already conducted a sample poll in Dallas, 
and is engaged in developing large-scale plans for this project. 

            But he needs further authorization and encouragement

Sirs:

    John A. Lomax, Honorary Curator of the Archive of American
Folk-song in the Library of Congress, is at this moment engaged 
in making an important collection of folk songs of the
Southwest for the Archive. Mr. Lomax carries in his car a
portable recording machine and takes down from the lips of
genuine folk singers and story tellers their songs, their 
stories, and the local history of the community. This material
has great scientific importance, and has proved of considerable 
use in the construction of radio programs which reach
a large number of people with the message of national unity.

    It is almost impossible for Mr. Lomax's work to be
carried on without the use of an automobile. He writes us
that his present tires are very badly worn and he hesitates
to embark on the trip planned for this spring without
obtaining a new set of tires and tubes. It would be a great
service to this important project and to the Library of
Congress if it would be possible for your board to give
Mr. Lomax a priority in the purchase of tires and tubes
in this instance.

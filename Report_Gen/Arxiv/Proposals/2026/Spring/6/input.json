  "Objective": "\n            The team is seeking support to evaluate the use of Google Trends data in estimating inflation and other\n            economic indicators. For this project, the students will review existing literature from the IMF\n            and other organizations that have used Google Trends data to assess economic activity, and they will\n            conduct their own analysis. The datasets will be the Consumer Price Index from countries with high \n            inflation and Google Trends data. After reviewing the literature, we expect the students to develop \n            a model to determine how CPI changes over time based on Google Trends data for specific terms.\n\n            ",

<h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>
<h2>Google Trends and Inflation (Time Series Project)</h2>
<h3>Proposed by: World Bank</h3>
<h4>Email:</h4>
<h4>Advisor: Amir Jafari</h4>
<h4>The George Washington University, Washington DC</h4>
<h4>Data Science Program</h4>
<h2>1 Objective:</h2>
<pre><code>        The team is seeking support to evaluate the use of Google Trends data in estimating inflation and other
        economic indicators. For this project, the students will review existing literature from the IMF
        and other organizations that have used Google Trends data to assess economic activity, and they will
        conduct their own analysis. The datasets will be the Consumer Price Index from countries with high 
        inflation and Google Trends data. After reviewing the literature, we expect the students to develop 
        a model to determine how CPI changes over time based on Google Trends data for specific terms.
